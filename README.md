## Aaronson Oracle

The computer opponent is an [Aaronson Oracle](https://github.com/elsehow/aaronson-oracle/tree/master),
predicting the player's next move from his previous moves.

Where the above link has two outcomes (correct/incorrect),
thus a 50:50 chance is expected in the perfectly random case,
here there are three outcomes (win/lose/tie).
Thus a 1/3 chance of each outcome is expected if playing perfectly randomly.
