# Rock, Paper, Scissors

A simple game implemented in different frontend frameworks for comparison:

* Angular ([source](https://github.com/Daniel-Methfessel/rock-paper-scissors/tree/master/angular), [live demo](https://angular.rock-paper-scissors.dame-software.com/))
* Blazor ([source](https://github.com/Daniel-Methfessel/rock-paper-scissors/tree/master/blazor), [live demo](https://blazor.rock-paper-scissors.dame-software.com/))
* React ([source](https://github.com/Daniel-Methfessel/rock-paper-scissors/tree/master/reactjs), [live demo](https://react.rock-paper-scissors.dame-software.com/))
* Vue (this version, [live demo](https://vue.rock-paper-scissors.dame-software.com/))

## Aaronson Oracle

The computer opponent is an [Aaronson Oracle](https://github.com/elsehow/aaronson-oracle/tree/master),
predicting the player's next move from his previous moves.

Where the above link has two outcomes (correct/incorrect),
thus a 50:50 chance is expected in the perfectly random case,
here there are three outcomes (win/lose/tie).
Thus a 1/3 chance of each outcome is expected if playing perfectly randomly.
